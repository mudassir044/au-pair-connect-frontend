Diagnosis: The build failure is caused by the "vite" command not being found, resulting in an exit code 127.

Solution: To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the "vite" package is included in the project dependencies. Verify that "vite" is listed in the "package.json" file. If it is missing, you should add it as a dependency by running:

npm install vite
After adding "vite" to the dependencies, commit the changes to the repository and trigger a new build.
